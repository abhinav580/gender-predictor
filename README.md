# gender-predictor
A simple machine learning example.
The code uses the scikit-learn machine learning library to train a decision tree on a small dataset of body metrics (height, width, and shoe size) labeled male or female. Then we can predict the gender of someone given a novel set of body metrics.

for the execution of the code you need to install some dependencies using pip
1. pip install numpy
2. pip install scipy
3. pip install sklearn
